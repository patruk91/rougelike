## Role-playing video game

Now it's time to implement your adventure game!

**Obligatory requirements from client (10 points):**

1. Prepare a story:
- an introduction screen,
- a character creation screen,
- a win/lose screen,

2. Create a hall of fame screen (highscores) - name, max level, time spent, monsters killed etc.

3. Create an about screen (info about authors!) and how-to-play screen (how to move, attack, drink potions etc.)

4. hink about at least 3 different levels/areas. Each of them should have an unique "feel" - different color and objects,
different enemies etc.

5. layer would like to gather at least 5 different items (all items must have a name, a type and a weight).
Types of items depends on the story of your game - i.e.
- Clothes
- Food
- Weapons

6. layer could be able to display detailed info about inventory - a table containing full information
about collected items, as well as available storage.

7. layer would like to meet some challenges (for example some kind of puzzles or riddles) to progress through
the game - i.e. to move from one level to another.

8. t the end of the game player would like to meet THE BOSS (use ASCII art, at least 5x5 characters, different colors).
To defeat boss you have to play hot-cold game (sounds familiar? :) and win. Thanks to defeating Boss player will feel
proud of (him/her)self.
